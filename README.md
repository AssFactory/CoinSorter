Coin Sorter
This is a machine designed for the automatic sorting of coins. It is built for mobile and robust use, powered by a standard 18V battery (AMPShare System).

Operation is managed via a minimalist single-button control and a 160x128 pixel color display, which presents all essential information at a glance.

Key Functions
1. Sorting & Counting The machine's core function is to sort all eight Euro coin denominations (1 Cent to 2 Euro). During the sorting process, the machine detects each coin and updates the count in real-time.

2. Color Display & Information The display acts as the primary information hub, permanently showing:

Total Value: The total monetary value of all registered coins in Euros.

Count per Type: A detailed list showing how many coins of each of the eight denominations (e.g., "10 x 2€", "15 x 1€", etc.) have been counted.

3. One-Button Operation All machine control is handled by a single, multi-function button:

Short Press (Start/Stop): A short press starts the sorting process. Another short press stops it immediately.

Long Press (Reset): If the button is held for longer than one second while the machine is off, the internal fault counter is reset.

Intelligent Protection Features
The machine is equipped with intelligent motor management to ensure longevity and smooth operation.

1. Automatic Jam Detection The system continuously monitors the motor load. If a coin blocks the mechanism or the motor is stalled for any reason, the machine detects this state immediately and stops the main operation to prevent damage.

2. Automatic Jam Recovery As soon as a jam is detected, the machine independently attempts to clear the blockage. It briefly runs the motor in reverse to free the stuck coin and then automatically restarts the sorting process.

3. Permanent Fault Lock-Out If the machine fails to resolve a jam after multiple consecutive attempts (e.g., 5 tries), it enters a permanent fault state. The motor is disabled to prevent overheating or damage. This state is only cleared when the user manually resets the fault counter via a long button press.
